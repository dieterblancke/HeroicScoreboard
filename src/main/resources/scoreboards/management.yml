# This will only impact servers that run a version older than 1.13
# Possible modes are:
# - SCOREBOARD_MAX_32 => this mode will allow for scoreboards UP TO 32 characters
# - SCOREBOARD_MAX_48 => this mode will allow for scoreboards UP TO 48 characters, but can be buggy every other time when using fast animations

# What should the MINIMUM interval of the scoreboard be (in MILLISECONDS)?
# Default is 50, which is the equivalent of one tick in minecraft.
# Lowest possible is 1 ms, if you go for 0 or lower, the scoreboard will be seen as a static scoreboard!
# Do note, the interval in the title & line frames are multiplications of this interval
# For example, if you enter interval 25 here, and interval 10 at title, the title will update very 250 seconds (25 * 10)
interval: 50
title:
  # This interval (in MILLISECONDS) will be multiplied by the scoreboard interval.
  # So if the scoreboard interval is 25, and this interval is 1, this frame will update every 25 milliseconds (40~ times a second)

  frames:
    # When using a scroller in the title in servers older than 1.13, the max width CANNOT GO OVER 32 (this would kick the client)
